# TODO service with Layered Architecture

In the TODO service, the `models/`, `services/`, `api/`, and `database/` directories each represent a different layer in the Layered Architecture, fulfilling distinct responsibilities and adhering to the separation of concerns principle.

## Presentation Layer: api/

This layer is responsible for handling user interactions and presenting data to the end user. In the context of the TODO service, the `api/` directory contains the routes and resources that define the RESTful API endpoints. These components receive requests from clients, process them by invoking the appropriate services from the Business Layer, and return responses in the desired format (such as JSON).

## Business Layer: models/ and services/

`models/` contains the domain entities or objects that represent the core business concepts, such as a Todo item in this case. These objects encapsulate the business logic and rules, defining the structure and behavior of the data within the application.
`services/` contains the business logic and operations that act upon the domain entities. These services are responsible for handling the application's core functionalities, such as creating, updating, or deleting a Todo item. They are also responsible for enforcing business rules and ensuring data consistency.


## Persistence Layer: database/ 

This layer is responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of data. In the TODO service, the `database/` directory contains the necessary components for interacting with the database, such as configuration files, migration scripts, and possibly ORM models. This layer abstracts the underlying data storage mechanism and provides a consistent interface for the Business Layer to interact with the data.
